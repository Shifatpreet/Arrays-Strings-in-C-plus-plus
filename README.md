Programs Included
1. Input and Display Array Elements
Description: Reads 5 integer values from the user and displays them.

Features: Basic input/output with arrays.

Algorithm:

Initialize an integer array of size 5.

Use a loop to read 5 integers from the user and store them in the array.

Use another loop to display the stored integers.

Sample Input: 2 3 5 6 7
Sample Output: 2 3 5 6 7

Conclusion:
This program demonstrates the basics of array input and output operations.

2. Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array
Description: Takes the size of the array from the user, reads integer values, and finds the maximum and minimum elements.

Features: Dynamic array size, max/min element finding.

Algorithm:

Read the size x of the array.

Declare an array of size x.

Input x integer values into the array.

Initialize max and min variables with the first element of the array.

Loop through the array to find the maximum and minimum values by comparing each element.

Print the maximum and minimum values.

Sample Input:

Sample output:

<img width="330" height="64" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/492dfe1e-250d-40ca-a1e0-d4fc1ed686f2" />
Conclusion:
This program effectively finds the largest and smallest elements in an array, useful in many practical scenarios like data analysis.

3. Search for an Element in an Array
Description: Searches for a user-provided value in a predefined array and reports its position if found.

Features: Linear search in array.

Algorithm:

Define an array with predefined values.

Input the search key from the user.

Loop through the array elements to check if the key matches any element.

If found, print the index and exit.

If not found, print a message indicating the key is not present.

Sample Input: 50
Sample Output: Key found at Location: 2

Conclusion:
This program demonstrates a simple linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.

4. Reverse an Array
Description: Reads array elements from the user and prints the array in reverse order.

Features: Reversing the elements using a loop.

Algorithm:

Read the size x of the array.

Input x elements into the array.

Loop backwards from the last element to the first, printing each element.

Sample Input:

<img width="267" height="120" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90973fd5-f085-476e-9050-c007f5a4352a" />

Sample Output:
Reversed Array is: 15 64 45 23 1

Conclusion:
This program shows how to reverse the order of elements in an array, a common array manipulation task.

5. Calculate Sum and Average of Array Elements
Description: Reads the size and elements of an array, then computes and displays the sum and average.

Features: Summation and average calculation.

Algorithm:

Read the size x of the array.

Input x elements into the array.

Initialize sum to 0.

Loop through the array to add all elements to sum.

Calculate average by dividing sum by x.

Print the sum and average.

Sample Input:

<img width="265" height="118" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086544c7-7a09-4809-b781-6b8c503b85cf" />

Sample output
<img width="277" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70720e48-7bd6-49d3-8fb0-cc95f5c6bf7a" />

Conclusion:
This program calculates the total and average of elements in an array, useful in statistics and data processing.
